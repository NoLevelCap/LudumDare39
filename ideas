Theme = "Running out of power"
You're going to get a lot of power management, like FTL, in this game. Are we doing power management? How can we do it different?

Idea 1:
A mining game where you tap to swing your pick or "move further down", when you swing you lose power on your pick. When you lose power you head to the surface.

Idea 2:
A card game about power management, in an oregon trail style chase. Whilst running to rescue a princess/prince, you have to use cards to manage your power. Two card types, a power card - this moves power from one section to another and a event card - this is an event where you pick an option. Every 100 yards you lose one power and use one card (or every 1000 you lose powerm every 100 you use a card). There are Four power slots too - Shields, Engines, Guns and Heating. Engines makes vehicle go faster, Shield makes your vehicle more protected, Guns better equip the attack of your vehicle, and Heating increases the heating of your vehicle - so you don't freeze or overheat in other biomes.

Idea 3:
A game like; Gauntlet where your health depletes over time.
